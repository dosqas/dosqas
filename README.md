  <summary>üõ†Ô∏è Current Projects</summary>
  
Currently not actively working on projects, but soon planning to start my **bachelor's thesis**, develop the full-scale **Spotify-integrated dosq.fm app**, and work on a few **publications in quantum programming**.

  <summary>üìÅ Past Projects</summary>

### [üé∂ Spotify Likes to Last.fm](https://github.com/dosqas/spotify-likes-to-lastfm)  
Python script that transfers your liked songs on **Spotify** to **Last.fm** as ‚Äúloved‚Äù tracks. I originally **forked this project** while searching for a tool like this, unsure if one even existed. I loved it so much that I made improvements to enhance its functionality. As someone passionate about **statistics and music**, I really enjoy using **Last.fm**, and this project combines both my interests perfectly.

### [üëæ SpaceDefender](https://github.com/dosqas/spacedefender)  
A wave-based variation of the 80s game **Space Defender**. Developed in **.NET C#** with **Windows Forms**.  
This project helped me learn **Windows Forms** and made me more comfortable with **C# .NET**. It was a great learning exercise, as it pushed me out of my comfort zone, requiring me to handle challenges like **collision detection**.

### [‚úàÔ∏è Planes](https://github.com/dosqas/planes)  
Implementation of the **Planes** game. Built in **Python** with **Pygame**, featuring a custom **smart AI algorithm**.  
I thoroughly enjoyed developing my own **smart AI algorithm** for the computer after studying papers on the AI algorithm based on **probability density functions** used for the **Battleships game**.

  <summary>üìö University Projects</summary>

### [üìö University Projects](https://github.com/dosqas/bbu-cuni-uni-projects)  
A repository of **past projects and assignments** completed for university courses, covering a range of programming concepts and technologies. Last semester, I took the following courses:
- **Web Development**: Covered both **client-side** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular) and **server-side** web technologies (PHP, ASP.NET, Spring, etc.).
- **Database Management Systems**: Learnt how to manage databases using **ADO.NET** with **C# .NET**, alongside database fundamentals including concurrency control, recovery, query optimization and distributed and parallel databases.
- **Software Engineering**: Focused on teamwork and full-stack development (the project is available in the [se-hospital-duo](https://github.com/dosqas/se-hospital-duo) repository).
- **Systems for Design and Implementation**: Involved developing a full-stack app by myself using **Next.js (Typescript)**, **ASP.NET Core**, and **PostgreSQL** (check out the project in the [dosq.fm-lite](https://github.com/dosqas/dosq.fm-lite) repository).
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Introduced the basics of **AI**, from Perceptrons all the way to CNNs and Computer Vision.

  <summary>üé∂ Hobbies</summary>
  
- I'm very passionate about listening to music and tracking how my tastes evolve over time, and I enjoy exploring vastly different genres, including **hip-hop**, **metal**, **ambient**, and **pop**.
- I also have a deep love for photography, especially shooting in black and white with a focus on capturing the architecture of buildings and their symmetry wherever I go.
