## üõ†Ô∏è Current Projects

### [dosq.fm](https://github.com/dosqas/dosq.fm)  
A **Spotify listening history tracker** with statistics and insights. Built with **Next.js (TypeScript)** and **PostgreSQL**.  
Currently focusing on building its **frontend**, while learning to make full use of **Next.js** along the way.

### [Amenintarea Maimutei](https://github.com/dosqas/UBB-SE-2025-AmenintareaMaimutei)  
Part of a **Hospital Management System** developed as a team project for the **Software Engineering course**. Built with **C#** and **.NET (WinUI)**.  
This project is greatly helping me learn to **work in a team environment** and improve collaboration skills.

## üìÅ Past Projects

### [SpaceDefender](https://github.com/dosqas/SpaceDefender)  
A wave-based variation of the 80s game **Space Defender**. Developed in **.NET C#** with **Windows Forms**.  
This project helped me learn **Windows Forms** and made me more comfortable with **C# .NET**. It was a great learning exercise, as it pushed me out of my comfort zone, requiring me to handle challenges like **collision detection**.

### [Minesweeper](https://github.com/dosqas/Minesweeper)  
A custom variation of **Minesweeper**. Developed in **Java** with **Swing**.  
I really enjoyed **developing my own textures** for the game. It also required me to debug a lot due to some **concurrency issues** since it‚Äôs multithreaded, but in the end, I enjoyed the challenge.

### [Planes-Game](https://github.com/dosqas/Planes-Game)  
Implementation of the **Planes** game. Built in **Python** with **Pygame**, featuring a custom **smart AI algorithm**.  
I thoroughly enjoyed developing my own **smart AI algorithm** for the computer after studying papers on the AI algorithm based on **probability density functions** used for the **Battleships game**.

## üìö University Projects

### [Uni-Projects](https://github.com/dosqas/Uni-Projects)  
A repository of **past projects and assignments** completed for university courses, covering a range of programming concepts and technologies. This semester, I‚Äôm taking the following courses:
- **Web Development**: Covers both **client-side** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and **server-side** web technologies (PHP, AJAX, ASP.NET, Angular, JSP, etc.).
- **Database Management Systems**: Teaches us to manage databases using **ADO.NET** with **C# .NET**.
- **Software Engineering**: Focuses on teamwork and full-stack development (the project is available in the [Amenintarea Maimutei](https://github.com/dosqas/UBB-SE-2025-AmenintareaMaimutei) repository).
- **Systems for Design and Implementation**: Involves developing a full-stack app by myself using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **PostgreSQL** (check out the project in the [dosq.fm](https://github.com/dosqas/dosq.fm) repository).
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Introduces the basics of **AI**.

## üé∂ Hobbies
- I'm very passionate about listening to music and tracking how my tastes evolve over time, and I enjoy exploring vastly different genres, including **hip-hop**, **metal**, **ambient**, and **pop**.
- I also have a deep love for photography, especially shooting in black and white with a focus on capturing the architecture of buildings and their symmetry wherever I go.
